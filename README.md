## Background

With the continuous increase of xUDT assets on CKB, the need to display asset logos is becoming increasingly prominent. However, there is currently a lack of a unified platform to manage and display the logos of these assets, which poses a certain challenge to DApp developers. To address this issue, We initiated the open source project xudtlogos, aiming to provide a unified logo management solution for xUDT assets on CKB.

## Our solution

- Unified Logo Management Platform: xudtlogos will provide a unified online platform where xUDT project owners can upload and manage their token logos according to specifications.
- Open Source Collaboration Model: The project will adopt an open source collaboration model, welcoming community members and xUDT project owners to participate in logo upload and maintenance work.
- Automatic Deployment and Display: Once logos are uploaded and approved, the system will automatically deploy them to the public website xudtlogs.cc, making it convenient for DApp developers and users to access and use them.
- Standardized Management: xudtlogos will establish a set of standards to ensure that uploaded logos meet uniform size, format, and quality requirements, improving display effectiveness and user experience.

## Expected Outcomes

- Provide a unified logo display platform for xUDT assets on CKB, enhancing convenience and user experience for DApp developers and users.
- Facilitate cooperation and communication between xUDT project owners and DApp developers, promoting the development and growth of the CKB ecosystem.

We look forward to the community's support and feedback, let's work together to contribute to the prosperity and health of the CKB ecosystem!
